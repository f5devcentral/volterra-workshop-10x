Module 1 - Use Case 1 - Expose public application and protect it with F5XC WAAP
###############################################################################

In this section, we will expose an existing and public internet facing application through F5XC Global Network.

The use case is simple:

* An application is already up and running somewhere (Datacenter, public cloud ...)
* This application has a public IP address or FQDN
* We will use and leverage the F5XC Global Network to expose this application
* The application will be available everywhere though all F5XC Regional Edge locations
* We will apply a WAAP policy

Today (May 2023), the worldwide POPs map is as below
